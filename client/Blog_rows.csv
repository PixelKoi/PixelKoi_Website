Install the library by running the following command in your project directory:
<br/>
<code>npm install react-blurhash</code> 
<br/><br/>

Import the Blurhash component from the library into the file where you want to use it:
<br/><br/>


<code>
import { Blurhash } from 'react-blurhash';
</code>
<br/>
<br/>

In your component's render method, add a Blurhash component with the hash and width and height props set:
<br/>
<br/>

  <code>&lt;Blurhash
  hash=""LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj""
  width={200}
  height={200}
/&gt;</code>
<br/>
<br/>

The hash prop is a string representation of the Blurhash for the image you want to display. You can generate a Blurhash for an image using a tool like blurhash-cli or an online generator.

You can also customize the placeholder image that is displayed while the Blurhash is being decoded by passing a placeholder prop:

<br/>
<br/>
<code>
&lt;Blurhash
  hash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"
  width={200}
  height={200}
  placeholder="https://example.com/placeholder.png"
&gt;
</code>
<br/>
<br/>

The placeholder prop can be a local image file or a remote URL.

Finally, you can add any additional styles to the Blurhash component that you would like:
<br/>
<br/>

<code>
&lt;Blurhash
  hash="LEHV6nWB2yk8pyo0adR*.7kCMdnj"
  width={200}
  height={200}
  style={{ borderRadius: 10 }}
&gt;
</code>
<br/>
<br/>

And that's it! With these steps, you can easily add a Blurhash placeholder for your images in your React project."
